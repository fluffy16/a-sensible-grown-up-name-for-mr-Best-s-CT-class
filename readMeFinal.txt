read the options on what you wish to do. 
number 1 adds to a list a number of your choice..
number 2 adds specified amount or random numbers within a specified range.
number 3 tells you what item is at a specified position in the list
number 4 sorts the list
number 5 searches for an item in the list using a random search
number 6 searches for an item in the list using a linear search
number 7 searches for an item in the list using a recursive binary search
number 8 searches for an item in the list using an iterative binary search
number 9 prints a list of your choice
number 10 simply allows you to quit the program.

recursive binary search cuts the list in half and searches one half of the side of the list that
has not been searched for the number the user hs inputted and repeats until you only have one number
left. then it tells you where your number is in the list.

iterative binary search does the same thing but instead of getting smaller and smaller, the sample size stays the same.

i dunno that's too hard, I'll take the meeting hopefully.
